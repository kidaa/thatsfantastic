At night, Michael and his team enjoy the spoils of their work by drinking, getting high and living the dreary pub life. When his Turkish associate is brutally murdered by Albanian brothers, Michael must readjust his dealings to get in with the new guys in West London. With added pressure from a former colleague and friend, an internal investigation into his team and a growing attachment for a woman being bought and sold by the Albanians, Michael goes from barely treading water to sinking fast as things get increasingly, chaotically and bloody.\n\n\tThose familiar with director Gerard Johnson\u2019s serial killer thriller TONY will recognize his nihilistic London populated with unlovable anti-heros. His sophomore effort bathes his characters is neon and ratchets up tensions to nearly unbearable levels. The events feel like they\u2019re happening in some alternate time, removed from any hope that the quickly unfolding nightmare could ever reach a happy conclusion. Centered on a powerful performance by Peter Ferdinando as Michael and supported by a host of familiar British actors (including both of Ben Wheatley\u2019s KILL LIST leads), HYENA ranks very highly among the modern crime films coming out of the UK.(Brian Kelley)",
