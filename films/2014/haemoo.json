The boat\u2019s owner wants to sell it, which would put Kang and his crew, including a young man named Dong-sik (K-pop star Yu-Chun Park), out of work. Kang can\u2019t afford to buy the boat, but he can\u2019t afford to lose it either. In this desperate time, Kang is offered a way out: the highly dangerous job of picking up a group of illegal Chinese-Korean immigrants and bringing them back to Korea. Kang and his crew accept the challenge. Of course, nothing goes as planned.\n\n\tBased on a stage play inspired true events, HAMEOO is an intense journey on a disastrous boat ride. Shim Sung-Bo is known as the screenwriter behind excellent films such as MEMORIES OF MURDER. With his directorial debut HAEMOO, he teams up with long-time collaborator Bong Joon-Ho to create a powerful character-driven work that is equal parts drama and thriller.\n\n\tGiven their history of collaboration, it is no surprise that Shim Sung-bo's directorial debut bears many similarities to the films of Bong Joon-Ho. The comparisons are particularly apt when it comes to HAEMOO's rich, complicated tone. HAEMOO effortlessly moves from black humor to dead serious drama to sharp sudden shocks, often within the same scene. In addition to the tonal complexity, HAEMOO is prefuse with a moral ambiguity that brings the narrative closer to reality than typical black-and-white cinematic narratives. As the characters navigate the treacherous seas, they also face various challenges that reach beyond the boundaries of their individual morality and ethics. (Rodney Perkins)",
