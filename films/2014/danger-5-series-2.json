    "raw_body": "Brief Summary\n\n\tWhen Adolf Hitler surfaces posing as a 1980s high school student, there can be only one response! The crack team of Danger 5 are pressed back into service to eliminate the Nazi threat once and for all!\n\nFull Description\n\n\tTucker. Claire. Jackson. Ilsa. Pierre. Their names have gone down in history as the brave heroes of Danger 5, the international team of super soldiers who would let nothing deter them in their mission to eliminate Adolf Hitler and his plans for global domination. Subterranean monkey people couldn\u2019t stop them. Giant robots couldn\u2019t stop them. Not even rocket launcher-wielding dinosaurs could stop them. For these were truly heroic heroes and their mission ended only with the end of Hitler.\n\n\tBut wait!... Could Hitler\u2019s death have been a ruse? A clever diversion? Is it possible that the Nazi leader escaped alive only to lurk in hiding, awaiting his chance to return? And what if that chance comes now? In the 1980s? In high school? Yes, it\u2019s time for Danger 5 to dust off their books and head back to class.\n\n\tFantastic Fest was proud to bring the first series of Dario Russo and David Ashby\u2019s award-winning Australian comedy to American audiences for the first time as part of our 2012 edition, and now we\u2019re thrilled to host the world premiere of the first three episodes of series two! Don\u2019t call it a parody, DANGER 5 is a glorious celebration, a loving mash-up of classic adventure tropes with B-grade science fiction and \u2013 in this new series \u2013 a dash of John Hughes. Because let\u2019s face it: That jerk who beat you up in high school? That was totally Adolf Hitler, right? (Todd Brown)"
