DWARVES KINGDOM takes us inside to meet its performer residents.\n\nFull Description\n\n\tA quick Google search will reveal several websites calling The Kingdom of Little People one of the world\u2019s \u201cmost offensive\u201d theme parks. The park, located in China, is home to over a hundred performers, all of whom have dwarfism and put on elaborate shows for snapshot-happy tourists. Director Matthew Salton takes his cameras to China to meet with the people living here, as well as with the park\u2019s creator and manager, to get a real feel about how those that actually rely on the park for their livelihood feel about the potentially exploitative attraction.\n\n\tDWARVES KINGDOM takes us inside a rare spot, one most people will only ever gawk at on internet lists, and puts real human faces to a place that is almost hard to believe exists. One resident is very aware of the Kingdom\u2019s potential to be seen as a human zoo while its CEO, talking through a smarmy smile, insists his business is based solely on philanthropy. While we can all understand the curious draw of little people, it\u2019s hard not to be fascinated by a place built just to allow people to come watch. DWARVES KINGDOM is touching, sometimes funny and\u2014just the way we like them at Fantastic Fest\u2014frequently uncomfortable. (Brian Kelley)\n\n\t\u00a0",
