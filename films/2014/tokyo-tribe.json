    "raw_body": "Brief Summary\n\n\tFestival favorite Sion Sono returns with an exercise in brash, colorful chaos pitting street gangs against one another in a bold hip hop musical.\n\nFull Description\n\n\tTokyo is at war, the city carved into pieces with each territory controlled by a variety of hip hop street gangs. Left to their own devices the gangs co-exists in an uneasy balance but when the order is disrupted \u2026 watch out, because things are going to get crazy.\n\n\tSion Sono has long been revered among cult film fans as a sort of patron saint of excess, the director never shying away from indulging his grand \u2013 and often bizarre, violent and troubling \u2013 visions. And with his adaptation of Santa Inoue\u2019s manga Sono has delivered on his grandest scale yet. Shot on a massive set to give the director every possible freedom and opportunity to bring his vision to the screen without any concessions to the real world, Tokyo Tribe delivers a sort of ultra-underground West Side Story with the characters bolder, the drugs flowing freely, and the (mostly) playful violence dial cranked up to eleven.\n\n\tBuilt around a cast of actual rappers, stunt men, first time actors discovered via open YouTube auditions and cult favorites like Riki Takeuchi, Tokyo Tribe is what happens when an in-the-blood maverick is given financial resources to match the biggest mainstream talents without any of the attendant restrictions. This is entertainment on a grand scale with every frame jammed with amazing imagery and every scene threatening to twist off in unexpected directions. Strap yourself in, Sono\u2019s bringing the crazy.(Todd Brown)"
